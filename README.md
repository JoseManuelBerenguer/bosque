# Bosque

## Description

**Bosque** is an application written in Max for emulating an imaginary soundscape composed of birds, amphibians, and insects, without aiming to exactly replicate nature. It is built using sine, square, and sawtooth oscillators. Noise is always present, as it helps simulate the unpredictability of natural sounds.

## Functionality

Once the file is downloaded and unzipped, run it in a demo version of Max (available at [Cycling74.com](https://cycling74.com)).

Two windows will open:

- **Left Window:** This window allows you to adjust the levels of each audio source and includes various controls that affect them:
  - Output speakers
  - Activity
  - Whether behaviors repeat in a loop
  - Mode of operation
  - The preset color that you want each source to execute

  In some cases, the programming allows you to trigger sounds and set the reading of new phrases.

- **Right Window:** This window has a master volume control and allows you to visualize the behavior of the sound sources in the outputs.
